**Question #11 - Topic 2**
An organization is developing a mobile social application and needs to collect logs from all devices on which it is installed. The organization is evaluating the
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to push logs and Amazon EMR to process data. They want to store data on HDFS using the default replication factor to replicate data among the cluster, but they are concerned about the durability of the data. Currently, they are producing 300 GB of raw data daily, with additional spikes during special events. They will need to scale out the Amazon EMR cluster to match the increase in streamed data.
Which solution prevents data loss and matches compute demand?

- A. Use multiple Amazon EBS volumes on Amazon EMR to store processed data and scale out the Amazon EMR cluster as needed.
- B. Use the EMR File System and Amazon S3 to store processed data and scale out the Amazon EMR cluster as needed.
- C. Use Amazon DynamoDB to store processed data and scale out the Amazon EMR cluster as needed.
- D. use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose and, instead of using Amazon EMR, stream logs directly into Amazon Elasticsearch Service.

**Correct answer : ( D )**

**Question #13 - Topic 2**
An organization needs to store sensitive information on Amazon S3 and process it through Amazon EMR. Data must be encrypted on Amazon S3 and Amazon
EMR at rest and in transit. Using Thrift Server, the Data Analysis team users HIVE to interact with this data. The organization would like to grant access to only specific databases and tables, giving permission only to the SELECT statement.
Which solution will protect the data and limit user access to the SELECT statement on a specific portion of data?

- A. Configure Transparent Data Encryption on Amazon EMR. Create an Amazon EC2 instance and install Apache Ranger. Configure the authorization on the cluster to use Apache Ranger.
- B. Configure data encryption at rest for EMR File System (EMRFS) on Amazon S3. Configure data encryption in transit for traffic between Amazon S3 and EMRFS. Configure storage and SQL base authorization on HiveServer2.
- C. Use AWS KMS for encryption of data. Configure and attach multiple roles with different permissions based on the different user needs.
- D. Configure Security Group on Amazon EMR. Create an Amazon VPC endpoint for Amazon S3. Configure HiveServer2 to use Kerberos authentication on the cluster.

**Question #14 - Topic 2**
Multiple rows in an Amazon Redshift table were accidentally deleted. A System Administrator is restoring the table from the most recent snapshot. The snapshot contains all rows that were in the table before the deletion.
What is the SIMPLEST solution to restore the table without impacting users?

- A. Restore the snapshot to a new Amazon Redshift cluster, then UNLOAD the table to Amazon S3. In the original cluster, TRUNCATE the table, then load the data from Amazon S3 by using a COPY command.
- B. Use the Restore Table from a Snapshot command and specify a new table name DROP the original table, then RENAME the new table to the original table name.
- C. Restore the snapshot to a new Amazon Redshift cluster. Create a DBLINK between the two clusters in the original cluster, TRUNCATE the destination table, then use an INSERT command to copy the data from the new cluster.
- D. Use the ALTER TABLE REVERT command and specify a time stamp of immediately before the data deletion. Specify the Amazon Resource Name of the snapshot as the SOURCE and use the OVERWRITE REPLACE option.

**Question #17 - Topic 2**
A gas company needs to monitor gas pressure in their pipelines. Pressure data is streamed from sensors placed throughout the pipelines to monitor the data in real time. When an anomaly is detected, the system must send a notification to open valve. An Amazon Kinesis stream collects the data from the sensors and an anomaly Kinesis stream triggers an AWS Lambda function to open the appropriate valve.
Which solution is the MOST cost-effective for responding to anomalies in real time?

- A. Attach a Kinesis Firehose to the stream and persist the sensor data in an Amazon S3 bucket. Schedule an AWS Lambda function to run a query in Amazon Athena against the data in Amazon S3 to identify anomalies. When a change is detected, the Lambda function sends a message to the anomaly stream to open the valve.
- B. Launch an Amazon EMR cluster that uses Spark Streaming to connect to the Kinesis stream and Spark machine learning to detect anomalies. When a change is detected, the Spark application sends a message to the anomaly stream to open the valve.
- C. Launch a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances with a Kinesis Client Library application that consumes the stream and aggregates sensor data over time to identify anomalies. When an anomaly is detected, the application sends a message to the anomaly stream to open the valve.
- D. Create a Kinesis Analytics application by using the RANDOM_CUT_FOREST function to detect an anomaly. When the anomaly score that is returned from the function is outside of an acceptable range, a message is sent to the anomaly stream to open the valve.

**Question #19 - Topic 2**
An organization has 10,000 devices that generate 100 GB of telemetry data per day, with each record size around 10 KB. Each record has 100 fields, and one field consists of unstructured log data with a "String" data type in the English language. Some fields are required for the real-time dashboard, but all fields must be available for long-term generation.
The organization also has 10 PB of previously cleaned and structured data, partitioned by Date, in a SAN that must be migrated to AWS within one month.
Currently, the organization does not have any real-time capabilities in their solution. Because of storage limitations in the on-premises data warehouse, selective data is loaded while generating the long-term trend with ANSI SQL queries through JDBC for visualization. In addition to the one-time data loading, the organization needs a cost-effective and real-time solution.
How can these requirements be met? (Choose two.)

- A. use AWS IoT to send data from devices to an Amazon SQS queue, create a set of workers in an Auto Scaling group and read records in batch from the queue to process and save the data. Fan out to an Amazon SNS queue attached with an AWS Lambda function to filter the request dataset and save it to Amazon Elasticsearch Service for real-time analytics.
- B. Create a Direct Connect connection between AWS and the on-premises data center and copy the data to Amazon S3 using S3 Acceleration. Use Amazon Athena to query the data.
- C. Use AWS IoT to send the data from devices to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams with the IoT rules engine. Use one Kinesis Data Firehose stream attached to a Kinesis stream to batch and stream the data partitioned by date. Use another Kinesis Firehose stream attached to the same Kinesis stream to filter out the required fields to ingest into Elasticsearch for real-time analytics.
- D. Use AWS IoT to send the data from devices to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams with the IoT rules engine. Use one Kinesis Data Firehose stream attached to a Kinesis stream to stream the data into an Amazon S3 bucket partitioned by date. Attach an AWS Lambda function with the same Kinesis stream to filter out the required fields for ingestion into Amazon DynamoDB for real-time analytics.
- E. use multiple AWS Snowball Edge devices to transfer data to Amazon S3, and use Amazon Athena to query the data.

Use IAM database authentication by using rds:db-tag IAM authentication policy and GRANT Amazon RDS row- level read permission per user.
- C. Create an Amazon DynamoDB table, with Amazon_ID as the partition key. The application uses amazon.com web identity federation to get a token that is used to assume an IAM role from AWS STS in the Role, use IAM condition context key dynamodb:LeadingKeys with IAM substitution variables $ and allow the required DynamoDB API operations in IAM JSON policy Action element for reading the records. {www.amazon.com:user_id}
- D. Create an Amazon DynamoDB table, with Amazon_ID as the partition key.
